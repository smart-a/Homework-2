        <p class="about">
          Liz and I had some pretty separate interests before we started dating.
          I liked gaming and she liked painting. Now that we’re dating, I still
          like gaming, but I also like a bunch of other things like art,
          writing, museums, travelling (kind of) and eating new things.
        </p>
        <p class="about">
          She’s also changed, as she still likes painting but also gaming and
          driving and taking trips to museums. We’ve changed each other’s
          political views quite a bit, and we agree on a lot of things in life.
        </p>
        <p class="about">
          My girlfriend, ultimately, has brought me from past to present and
          from uncertainty to happiness.
