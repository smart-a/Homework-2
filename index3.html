        <h3>Liz Care</h3>
        <p class="about">
            Liz doesn’t only care about fish. When people are hurt or in danger, my girlfriend feels a great deal of stress and compassion. 
            Even when she doesn’t know the person well, she’ll still have them on her mind until she knows they’re OK. 
            Not only this, but she often puts others before herself. With the combination of selflessness and care for others,
            my girlfriend really is an incredibly kind and special person.
        </p>
        <p class="about">
            Like any truly special person, Liz sets very high expectations for herself. 
            If she doesn’t make sure everyone around her is OK, she feels like a bad person instead of feeling like 
            a (for lack of better words) normal person. If she forgets something or sleeps in and misses something 
            important (which doesn’t happen often for her) she feels a tremendous amount of guilt — which might be expected — 
            that persists and haunts her for long amounts of time. 
        </p>
        <p class="about">
            I know, however, that Liz Pedone is a wonderful person; 
            she’s smart, kind, dedicated, compassionate and gorgeous.
